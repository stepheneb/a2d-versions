Eight versions of the model, visualization, and graphing developed in https://github.com/stepheneb/avalanche2d-js
which implements a simple computational model of self-organizing-criticality.

The eight versions of the model demonstrate the effectiveness of different performance optimizations.

The earliest model runs at about 250 steps per second while the last model runs about 10,500 model
steps per second, a 42x performance increase.
